- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MikhaelEmpi
- I have experience as a Front End Web Developer at a company called Project.In. In that experience
I was responsible for designing websites according to client requests, developing websites with the Bootstrap framework and doing regular website maintenance.
With this experience, I believe I can give the best contribution in the Front End Web Developer field.
